In this directory there are the matlab scripts we used for the 
experiments described in CVPR 2014: 
"Learning to Learn, from Transfer Learning to Domain Adaptation: A Unifying Perspective".
Cite this paper as reference for the software.

This code has been tested on Matlab 2013a on Linux.

The code is part of H-L2L for Binary Transfer Learning, refer to section 5.2 in the paper. 
For Multiclass Transfer Learning code, please contact the author directly.

Directory structure
- classifier: script of classifier
- data: 6 unrelated classes, 6 related classes, 10 mixed classes
- script: H-L2L algorithm

To run the code
1. in demo.m, change dataset name according to the given folder name
2. run demo.m

For running all classes in Caltech-256, please refer to
